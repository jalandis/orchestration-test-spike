Test Spike of Orchestration Methods

# Multi Vagrant Test Environment
Vagrant will be used to create multiple VM's with networking automatically setup to simulate a real environment.

A minimum of 3 servers will be used but the number is configurable depending on the `cluster_size` variable in your `orka/user_settings.yaml` file.
